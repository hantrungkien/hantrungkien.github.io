Watched His eye is on the sparrow of playbyhear.com saved for offline viewing from YouTube

	- He differentiates 5 from 5 major! Hmmmm
	His 5 is IV/V. While his 5 major is the real V or V7
	
	- he also calls secondary dominants as "Big". For example, III7 is called Big 3

he also said that we can susubstitute bvii for iidim in 5:25 min of the video
