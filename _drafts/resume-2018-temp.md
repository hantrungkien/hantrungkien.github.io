          We were using ASP.NET WebForms and the MVP design pattern to build the software. We used MS Test and Moq in writing Unit Tests. There was also a legacy desktop version of the enroller that we were maintaining.

          There were also a few parts of the web app that were being converted to ASP.NET MVC. So I also had a little experience using ASP.NET MVC at work.

  <strong>I'm an Initiate</strong>
</h2>

Using [Terence McGhee's "Software Ninja Class Hierarchy"](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html), <em>today</em>, I consider myself to be an [**Initiate**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#initiate), because I _try_ to write code that is easy to read. I do that because I know that programmers spend more time reading code that writing code. I'm not saying that I _always_ write code that is easy to read. I still write messy code during _trying_ times or during _boring_ times or _lazy_ times, with the intention of cleaning them up _later_ of course :grin:. But I'm already aware, through experience, that code that is easy to read is valuable code. I also understand that _later_ means _never_ so if your organization insist that I should _never_ write messy code, I will be happy to comply. :smile:

I would just like to add that you might still forgive me if I consider myself a [**Level "Zero" Codesmith**](https://terencemcghee.com/FileStore/Tech/1D0C454A70AC3AEF01BB1BAAD94C8753.html#codesmith) because I have little knowledge about TDD, the SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, and some Design Patterns. (Please note that in programming, _"zero"_ has meaning other than _"none"_ :grin:)

<h2 id="learning-philosophy">
    <strong>My learning philosophy today on software development</strong>
</h2>

When I started coding, my focus on learning was trying to master the specifics of a programming language.

Then a few years later, my focused moved into trying to master specific frameworks and libraries.

But today, my focus moved into learning the basic principles of software design and methodologies, because these are the things that will help me make software that is [maintainable](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html), which many master programmers say is the primary value of software. 


Today, my learning philosophy is like this:

> [Just-in-time learning](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) about specific languages and frameworks and libraries

> Ahead-of-time learning about basic principles and practices in software development, and about [programming in general](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)

I hope that kind of learning philosophy is okay with you. :smile:

When I will be hired in your company, I will spend the first few weeks concentrating on learning about the structure/architecture of the project I will be involved in, learning about the coding standards being used by the team, learning about the specific frameworks and libraries and languages that are being used in the project, and most importantly learning about the domain of the business that the software is being built for, even to the point of learning _why_ the software was built.

When I reach the point where am already comfortable with my knowledge on the specific frameworks and libraries being used in the project, I will move my concentration again into [learning about programming _in general_.](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43)




<!--
4. If I will be working on an existing project, I might be needing lots of help in understanding the structure of the project in the first few weeks... most expecially when I am involved in a project where I am not yet familiar with the frameworks or libraries that are being used. 
<br /><br />
But if I will be involved in new projects... I believe that I can _help_ with the architecture of _new_ projects, even when I am not yet familiar with the specific frameworks and libraries that will be used in that project --- I can learn about the frameworks and libraries _inline_, I mean, during my vacant times. :smile:

Thank you! :smile:

I think I am enjoying more when I am involved design part of creating software systems --- by _design_ I mean the design or architecture of the software and not the UI part.

And because I concentrate on the _design_ part of the system, I think I can still be able to work on **new** projects even when I am not yet very familiar with the specific frameworks or libraries those projects, as long as my teammates are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries that we will be using.

I am kind of one who wants to help keep software from rotting --- and I would like to emphasize the word **_help_** because I can't do it on my own, most especially when I am not yet familiar with the technologies that will be used in the project.

I think I will also enjoy mentoring junior software developers.

I think I will be excited with work most when I am involved deciding about the architecture of new software system, or when I am involved in an existing software that has a good architecture, or when I am involved in a project whose team practices TDD.



I would also like to know what my responsibilities will be when I get hired.
