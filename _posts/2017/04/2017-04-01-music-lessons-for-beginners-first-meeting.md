<!-- April 1, 2017 11:50:00 PM Philippine Time -->

This afternoon, I started (again) music lessons for beginners in our small church in our small city, Kidapawan, Philippines.

I'm writing this just to document what I am doing so that if this lessons will happen again in the future, I can refer to this post again for ideas on what to teach.

I had 4 students.

Before our lesson started (after the Bible reading and prayer of course), I made them listen and watch [Greg Howlett](https://greghowlett.com/?affid=5114) play "His Eye is On The Sparrow".

<small>[In case you are interested, Here is his [blog post about his work on "His Eye is On the Sparrow"](https://greghowlett.com/blog/thoughts/010911.aspx)]

After watching that, I asked them if they want to become as good as Greg Howlett.

They said "Yes!" of course!

Then I told them that I am not able to make them as good as Greg Howlett :smile: ... but I am able to teach them basic concepts about music and the piano.

I told them that if they want to become like Greg Howlett, they can make him their teacher someday, and learn lots of stuff from him, when they already have a job and can be able to pay for his online music school.

Then I told them that we will not be calling our sessions _"Piano Lessons"_ because I think I am not the best piano teacher they can have. Instead, we will call it _"Music Lessons: Using the piano as our primary tool" (I intend to use the voice as our secondary tool).

## Outline of the Lesson

I. The **Three Elements of Music**

1. Melody - (ang gina-kanta)
2. Rhythm - (the counting/beats)
3. Harmony - (ex. SATB, chords)

II. The staff and the notation being used by musicians today

- C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
- do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
- 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8
- I-II-III-IV-V-VI-VII-
- i-ii-iii-iv-v-vi-vii-
- where is _middle C_ on the staff with a G-clef

III. How to locate **C** on the keyboard.
- using the group of 2 black keys and the group of 3 black keys

III. How to play "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Stars"

After the lessons I gave them a copy of the sheet music of ["Twinkle, Twinkle Little Stars"](http://www.music-for-music-teachers.com/twinkle-twinkle.html) which I downloaded from www.music-for-music-teachers.com.
