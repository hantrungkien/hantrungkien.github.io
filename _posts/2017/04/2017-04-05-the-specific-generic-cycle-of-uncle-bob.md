<!-- April 6, 2017 01:05:00 AM Philippine Time -->

I only knew that Uncle Bob Martin has a blog just last year, 2016, (I think it was April) after a colleague posted a link of the blog post [The Programmer's Oath](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html) in out chat group at work.

I learned of the name Robert Martin from his book "Clean Code" which one of my co-workers made us read a few years ago. (I also read about his name and his books in John Sonmez's blog and Scott Hanselman's blog)

"Clean Code" was a very good book. I learned a lot from it. 

<!--more-->

I was not able to finish it (yet). But I'm going to [buy a physical copy](/2017/03/27/why-I-started-buying-physical-books/) of that book a few days from now (when it's price at bookdepository will hit the 45% discount again :blush:) so I can finish it. I recently read someone who wrote that the last(?) chapter, the one with many examples, is the best part of the book. And I was not able to read that part yet.

Let's get to the topic of this post :smile:

One of Uncle Bob's latest blog posts on TDD, [_"TDD Harms Architecture"_](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html), has this statement.

> As the tests get more **specific**, the production code gets more **generic**.

Then he added,

> This is (to me) one of the most important revelations about TDD in the last 16 years.

This intrigued me!

What does Uncle Bob mean by that _specific-generic_ thing?

I hoped Uncle Bob write more about that statement in his next blog posts.

. . .

But a few days after I read that post, I found out that he has already written about it before -- in [The Cycles of TDD](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html). And from there, he linked to his very old article [The Specific/Generic cycle](http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/11/craftsman-63-specifics-and-generics.html).

It was posted last November 2010!! :astonished:

So this idea is already in his head 10 years ago! (Or even many years before 2010!)

Wow!

I do not yet know TDD by heart and I do not yet fully understand his statement that I quoted above. But if you also want to have an initial understanding of what Uncle Bob means, I think the [Specific/Generic cycle](http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/11/craftsman-63-specifics-and-generics.html) post is a very good place to start.

I'm wondering... How many years would it take for a very good idea to become mainstream?
