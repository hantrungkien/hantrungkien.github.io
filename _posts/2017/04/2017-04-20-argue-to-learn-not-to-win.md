From the book ["How to Win Friends and Influence People"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780091906818?a_aid=jflaga) I learned that the best way to win an argument is to avoid it

Ahh! They were not arguing to win. They were arguing to learn from each other.

So it's okay to argue if your goal and your colleague's goal is to learn; but it's best to avoid arguments if either your goal or your colleague's goal is to win.
