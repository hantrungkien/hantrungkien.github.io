Robert Martin is talking about some important history of software development here; why we are where we are today.

Very interesting!

I disagree with his conclusion in the introduction part -- the years the first man and the first woman appeared -- because I have a different bias than Uncle Bob Martin when it comes to the history of the human race (take note that [all of us have some biases](/memorabilia/quotes/everyone-is-biased/) that influence the conclusions that we make)...

...but I really like listening to Bob Martin's talks on software development :smile:

## Here are some of the history of software development he talked about:

> We used to think about design and architecture...

> ...but then our focus changed into "what frameworks should we use to help us" 

> But a few years after we forgot about design and architecture, we realized that...

> "The web is not an architecture. **The web is an I/O device**. And we learned many years ago that we want to be independent of I/O devices"

> "**The database is not the center of our system**. Our application should rule the database... The database is also an I/O device; something we want to be independent of."


## Other interesting stuffs:

> In doing agile, we do not decry upfront design; we decry BIG upfront design.

> The test of a true test: **a true test does not need to be connected to anything**.

He also talked a little about the Clean Architecture that he already talked about in his other talks.

I will post my notes on his talk on ["Architecture: The Lost Years"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg) a few days from now.

Happy listening to Uncle Bob Martin!
