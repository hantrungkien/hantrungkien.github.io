[Like I said before](/2017/04/15/agility-and-architecture-by-uncle-bob-martin-oop-2015-keynote/), I really like listening to Uncle Bob Martin's talks.

Last Friday, while riding home from Davao, I listened to his talk on "The Future of Programming".

Here are some points from the talk which I think are important, at least to me. :smile:

at about 9:00

> During the early days of software, roughly half of the programmers were women!


at about 13:00

> He said that we should read "The Annotated Turing"

I will buy it after I already bought the other books that I need now like the book ["Working Effectively with Legacy Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055?a_aid=jflaga) and ["Clean Code"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Code-Robert-C-Martin/9780132350884?a_aid=jflaga).


at about 52:00

> We're in a state of perpetual inexperience. :cry:


at about 57:00

> What we have learned since the 70's is more on what not to do than what to do.

> 1. Don't use unrestrained goto.
> 2. Don't use pointers to functions.
> 3. Don't use assignments.


at about 1:06:00

> We have a problem: we do not agree on our own technical disciplines.


at about 1:13:00

> We did not get in the business of software to kill people; but we are killing people. :cry:

By the way, Jesus the Christ conquered death. He ultimately is the solution to our problem.

Try googling for _"The gospel of Jesus Christ"_ if you want to know more about him.
