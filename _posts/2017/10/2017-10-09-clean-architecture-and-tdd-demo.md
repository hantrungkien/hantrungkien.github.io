Like what I said in [a previous blog post](/2017/10/08/clean-architecture-and-tdd-devcon-davao-2017/), I would like to compensate for the failure of not being able to finish my demo during the talk last Saturday. So I have created videos of me performing the demo.

Here are the videos...

In these videos, you will see me making mistakes; you will hear me mispronouncing words :smile:; you will see me breaking the rule of writing the tests first. :laughing:

If you have comments, suggestions, or feedback (negative or positive) about these videos (and about the talk last Saturday, if you were there during the talk :smile:), please tell me.

Thanks.
