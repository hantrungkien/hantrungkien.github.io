About four weeks before my [talk](/2017/10/08/clean-architecture-and-tdd-devcon-davao-2017) for DevCon Davao 2017 last October 7, I started reading the "Rough Cuts" of Uncle Bob Martin's book "Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design" available at Safari Books Online. _(I might find gems in it I can use to answer questions that might be thrown at me during the talk! :smile:)_

The book was very good. Some blurry concepts, which I read in Uncle Bob's blog and heard in his talks, were cleared.

But in chapter four of the book, he said this:

> Of course, not all statements are provable. The statement: "This is a lie." is neither true nor false. It is one of the simplest examples of a statement that is not provable.

I was skeptical about that.

_Unprovable_? 

<!--more-->

_Neither true nor false?_

That statement sounds like it must be _true_ or _false_ to me!

I am a big fan of Uncle Bob. I am inclined to believe almost everything that he says about programming because I am inexperienced while he is very experienced. :smile: _(That might be [bad](https://dev.to/bosepchuk/is-uncle-bob-serious-dhi), I'm not sure... but I'm still learning.)_

But because [I knew that I have a different set of biases than him](/2017/04/15/agility-and-architecture-by-uncle-bob-martin-oop-2015-keynote), I am sometimes skeptical when he talks about things that do not seem to match my biases or [worldview](http://www.defendingthebible.org/worldviews.html). _(I believe that Uncle Bob will not be angry with a student not believing everything that he says :grin:)_

So I tried googling about the _"this is a lie"_ thing.

I found the article ["Resolving the Liar's Paradox"](http://steve-patterson.com/resolving-the-liars-paradox/) of Steve Patterson.

_Ahh!_ 

So that statement was supposed to be a what they call a **paradox**.

(Please read his article if you want to know how the seeming paradox is resolved.)

I found this very interesting!

In the article, Steve Patterson says this:

> ... it shouldn’t be surprising that the Liar’s Paradox can be resolved because **all paradoxes, by their nature, can be resolved**. They don’t exist because they can't exist.

Hmmm...

_(More please...)_

In ["Paradox, Nonsense, and California"](http://steve-patterson.com/paradox-nonsense-california/), he said this:

> **All paradoxes can be resolved.** It’s just a matter of effort... **Nothing in existence contradicts itself.** It can not, by definition of what we mean by "contradict". This understanding is fundamental for developing an accurate worldview.

Wow! _I want to know more about what this thinker thinks and says..._

In his [start page](http://steve-patterson.com/start/), he said that he is **creating an entire worldview**.

[_Worldview!!!_](http://www.defendingthebible.org/worldviews.html)

I first heard that term from, [Jason Lisle](https://answersingenesis.org/world-religions/atheism/atheism-an-irrational-worldview/) and Ken Ham, and then from [Greg Bahnsen](http://www.datpostmil.com/the-great-debate-greg-bahnsen-vs-gordon-stein/), and from many others like [Albert Mohler](http://www.albertmohler.com/2016/10/27/will-live-now-francis-schaeffers-live-40-years/)...

This makes me the more interested!

What could this _new_ worldview be?

Would this _new_ [worldview](http://www.defendingthebible.org/worldviews.html) explain things much better than Christianity does?
