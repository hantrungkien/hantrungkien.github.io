Why am I transcribing _(some of) some of_ Uncle Bob Martin's talks? <small> (And some of the other masters' talks?</small>)

> I will not able to read everything Uncle Bob has read and I will not be able to experience everything Uncle Bob has experienced (_Also_, I don't want to experience some of his _bad_ experiences. :smile:)

<!--more-->

> I also will not be able to buy and read all the books he has written.

> I consider Uncle Bob's talks as the summary of what he thinks -- maybe the summary of all his books.

> I transcribe _(some of) some of_ these talks because I believe that someday I can be able to use these _notes_ when I need to propose solutions to problems that I might encounter at work -- I have someone more authoritative and more experienced than I am to appeal to, _Uncle Bob and the other Masters_.


And why am I putting them on my blog?

> So that they will be easy to find! :smile: like what one master, Scott Hanselman, did [here](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheVBEquivalentToCTypeofKeyword.aspx).
