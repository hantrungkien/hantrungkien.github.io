A friend told me about these _48 Laws of Power_ many months ago.

I tried to google for it a few days after I heard about it.

<span class="message message-compressed float-right">
_(I already knew about the ["friend being envious"](/2017/05/20/crab-mentality-not-a-filipino-only-problem) part.)_
</span>

But after reading Law #2, _"Never put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn how to use Enemies_, I said to myself, _"Learn to use enemies? **Create enemies if you don't have one?** :open_mouth: Wut!? I don't want to create enemies! And if someone wants me to become their enemy, I want to distance myself from them! This is nonsense!"_

I ignored it. I do not need these kinds of things.

I was not very interested with _"Laws of Power"_ in the first place because I did not want to become powerful. I wanted to become influential, for the good of course, and that's the reason why the book ["How to Win Friends and Influence People"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780091906818?a_aid=jflaga)  appealed to me. But becoming "powerful"?? We cannot outpower God, so why try? (But, _of course_, I understand that we need _good_ and _powerful_ leaders.)

But last Friday, I realized that I needed to know what other Christians think about these "48 Laws of Power". So I googled for _**"Christian response to the 48 Laws on Power"**_, or something like that.

I found ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​[Lisa David- Bedrick's blog post](http://orangecountyangel.blogspot.com/2013/05/48-laws-of-power.html) about it.

She said this:

> As a disclaimer I will say: the whole philosophy in all these "laws of power" is to act like you love people even though you are playing them, which bothers me of course. Why not actually love people and then you won't have to act like you do? Eventually people will see behind the mask, so all of this will only work for a time, until the people you are trying to have power over get smarter and see past your games. 
<br /><br />
> This will not work forever. People can only be played for so long. Like a parent/child relationship or friendship, when the child grows up, they realize they no longer need the parent. These rules are all about treating people like children and fooling them. Well what about when they psychologically grow up and become smarter or as smart as you? Then what? Then the person has to start from square one with a new set of gullible people. 

<!--<small>(I have to learn how to love people again.)</small>-->

This sounds very _alarming_ to me. This book was a bestseller! _What if others will use it against me or against those that are dear to me?_

I told my friend who introduced these _so-called "laws"_ to me that I'm going to memorize them and make jokes about them, especially those _"laws"_ I disagree with -- _the evil "laws"_ -- so that others will become aware of them, and will not become victims of them.

(_Oooops! I think I violated Law 3: Conceal you intentions. Tsk, tsk._)

But if things go wrong, and ALL people will be fooled into thinking that these _so-called laws_ will make them into gods...


> "When everyone is super, no one will be" - from the words of the primary villain in "The Incredibles"


(_Does that mean that I myself am influenced by Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End?? Tsk tsk!_)


If you have any comment about my English (and other things), please tell me. (_Note: I'm not trying to appy Law 46 on this one. I'm being truthful on this one. :smile: Those who know English know that I'm being truthful on that one._)

## Other Reviews

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power):

> Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer said that Greene's so-called laws are based on isolated examples, and not on solid research. Kirkus Reviews said Greene offers no evidence to support his world view, Greene's laws contradict each other, and the book is "simply nonsense"... There has been no empirical research that any of the laws actually achieve positive social results.

[Kirkus Reviews:](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/robert-greene/the-48-laws-of-power/)

> "If the authors are serious, this is a silly, distasteful book. If they are not, it’s a brilliant satire."

[Lisa Davis-Bedrick: ](http://orangecountyangel.blogspot.com/2013/05/48-laws-of-power.html)

> "...the mind of a con-artist is never at rest because they know their whole life is a lie. They know that at any moment they might be caught. These laws do not bring power but rather enslavement. Why? Because anyone who tells a lie is then a slave to that lie. Lies build upon lies like a web trapping you inside the lies until you are caught.
<br /><br />
> "But you will still grow wiser if you read them and learn the schemes people try to play on other people."

## On How to Win Friends and Influence People

While writing this blog post, I also tried to google on some thoughts of other Christians regarding the book ["How to Win Friends and Influence People"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780091906818?a_aid=jflaga)

I found this very interesting:

> If you want to win friends and influence people, stop worrying about how you look to them. And start worrying about how you look to God. He will honor your devotion and exalt you in the eyes of others.
<br /><br />
> “Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him and He will do this: He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.” Psalm 37:5-6

I really love these short, simple, and very intuitive, _no-need-to-memorize_ principles or guidelines about how to do things.

:+1:

_What should I do to look good to God?_
