In one of Uncle Bob Martin's talks, ["The Last Programming Language"](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-0/show), and in some of his blog posts, for instance, ["The Churn"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/07/27/TheChurn.html), he is suggesting that we, programmers, need to choose one or two programming languages that we can use as our _one notation_ for writing code. (He was suggesting Clojure.)

But, at the end of the talk, he said that it might not happen today. Maybe in the future it will --- our children (read _future programmers_) might program using only one (or two) languages for (almost) everything.

But, having read his blog posts on [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and having heard [his talks on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsjsiz2A9mg) on youtube, I think we can still have an equivalent of a _one-language-on-everything_ experience during our lifetime.

I think that can happen if all programmers<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> and all IT/CS students (read _future programmers_) will become aware of this _Clean Architecture_ idea (or its equivalents: ports-and-adapters, hexagonal architecture, onion architecture, the boundary-controller-entity model)

When all programmers<sup id="footnote-indicator-2">[[2]](#footnote-2)</sup> become aware of the Clean Architecture model... 

I believe we all will like it, because it has with it attached the promise of _control_ with our software projects!

> Control!?

I think yes! Maybe not 100% control? I think the amount of control that a team can get from using the Clean Architecture model depends on the people involved in the project.

So, yes! Control... 

And if coupled with TDD... more control!!! :grin:

Okay, back to the _one language_ thing...

If students will be introduced to the Clean Architecture model at school, and if industry practitioners implement their projects using the Clean Architecture model, then programmers new to these projects will not be spending too much time getting familiar with the structure of a project. Some can even go directly to solving problems they were hired to solve, if they are already familiar with the frameworks or libraries being used in the project.

_(Or maybe not? Maybe I'm just too optimistic about this?)_

We can also easily switch from one project to another, depending on where we are needed.

That experience would be like having only _one language!_

What do you think?

No?

But it could be _a step_ towards a _one (or two) programming language(s) world_.

(I'm assuming here that a _one programming language world_ is a better world.)

I heard someone said before that one awareness, if we open our eyes to it, can bring about another awareness, which can bring about yet another awareness.

Maybe this awareness to the Clean Architecture idea will make our eyes opened to other awarenesses too...

<!--, such as, that our main job as programmers is not to learn new frameworks or libraries that are popping up from everywhere everyday.

I believe we, programmers of today, are all guilty of this.

"There's this new shiny thing coming out today. I should learn it"

Of course there is nothing wrong with that, as long as it is not getting in the way of our main job as programmers.

What is the main job of programmers?

I think the main job of programmers is to make software that solves problems or can automate things while, at the same time, looking for ways to make that software easy to change. Software are called software because they are supposed to be easy to change, right? That's what Uncle Bob said in one of his talks.

Many programmers think that that is where our focus should be --- making software that are easy to change.

Of course the frameworks and libraries are very important also, but we should remember that the frameworks and libraries come and go, but our software systems might stay for so many years.

Perhaps there is a way to design our software systems so that it will be easy to replace frameworks or libraries when we need better ones?

The Clean Architecture model?
