Another trivia!

In about 42:10 minutes in Lecture 2 of [MIT OCW 6.0002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.htm), Prof. John Guttag inserted in his lecture the history of dynamic programming --- why is it called _"dynamic programming"_?

He said that the inventor, Richard Bellman, chose the name _"dynamic programming"_ because 

> ... **it did not mean anything**. The inventor was doing mathematics and at that time, he was being funded by a part of the defense department that didn't approve of mathematics, and he wanted to conceal that fact...

In his slides, he qouted the inventor himself:

> "The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research... I felt I had to do something to sheild Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics... What title, what name, could I choose? ... It's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.
