<!-- June 6, 2017 04:00:00 AM Philippine Time -->


<u title="June 4, 2017">Sunday.</u>

The text of the sermon was Ephesians 4: 1-4 (and Philippians 2:3ff).

One Christian trait that was presented was "lowliness of mind" -- not to think of ourselves as being higher than others.

I am guilty of that, I think. Many times, I think of myself as better than others. This is often revealed in my job as a programmer.

## Code and bad words

When adding new features (and even when debugging), you have to read code that someone else wrote <small>(sometimes, that _"someone else"_ could be me, only that I forgot that it was me! :laughing:)</small>

_"Why is this written like this?"_ <small>(in my mind only)</small>

_"What!!"_ <small>(verbally :smile:)</small>

_"WT*!"_ <small>(also in my mind only of course :smile:)</small>

Bad words, yes! I feel being a hypocrite when I do that.

And...

**Debugging** -- one of the most, if not the most, depressing parts of software development.

You read the bug report. 

_"That's easy to fix!"._ :bulb: (Or so you thought!)

After 4 hours... depression kicks in. :laughing: And during depressing times... [you know what happens...](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/03/01/deal-with-legacy-code/)

_"WT*!"_

From where did I learn to use those words?


## The background

About three years ago, the book Clean Code was introduced to us by a workmate. (By that time, I had already heard about this book but I have not read it yet.)

It has this joke I cannot forget: _"the only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute"_.


[![The only valid measurement of code quality - WTFs/minute](http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg)](http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m)


That was funny. But I never planned of using those words -- _"WTF"_. It was against my conscience to use bad words. :laughing:

But, alas, depressing moments come --- the depressing moments never experienced before! Filthy words started to come out of my heart. Then from my heart to my mouth. --- _"I want to leave Christianity!"_

(_Wait! What?!_ You want to leave? I thought _"you, wanting to leave"_ is the _reason_ of the depressing moments, not the _result!_ Oh well... maybe it is both.)

The joke became real.

But... then... I felt kind of vindicated when I found out that other Christians, like [Micah Murray](http://micahjmurray.com/i-dont-have-my-shit-together), also sometimes use those words!

## I should stop already

But Ray Comfort is against the use of those words! And I also think that it is bad if I continue on using those words.

I should be changing already. I should stop being a [hypocrite](https://odb.org/2011/01/26/like-a-hypocrite/).

It took many years for the bad attitude to develop. Maybe it will also take many years to regain the good one.

May God give me grace







<!--Sometimes, I also fall into the temptation of thinking that I deserve better than this or that.

## It was a slow process...

I have not always been like that. I was of a lowly mind in the past (I think :smile:); not 100% lowly of course, but it was not like today where my lowliness is close to zero (I'm exaggerating, of course :laughing:)

I think the reason for this is because for the past 10 or so years, I seldom see or meet people who cares about things. I don't know how to say that clearly but I'm going to give an example:

Many people in the colleges I attended did not care about students cheating. (There were a few who cared _of course_, and I loved them for that.) Does that mean that the administrators did not care also? Maybe they only cared about attracting as many students as they can to get their money -- _"Study in our college; you can cheat here all you want; get your diplomas by cheating"_

<small>(I'm angry I think.)</small>

Do they not realize the kind of citizens they are producing by tolerating cheating?

<small>(Why so serious? :laughing:)</small>

Of course I was one of those who tolerated cheating. Tsk, tsk. I did not do anything significant for it to stop.

But, setting aside this blaming game, I think these were the kind of experiences that made me think that people generally does not care.



## The process continues...

I never planned of using those words -- _"WTF"_. It was against my conscience to use bad words. :laughing:

But, alas, depressing moments come! -- The depressing moments never experienced before.

I can't remember anymore when I first used the F word. Maybe I first used it in my mind. Then verbally, when I was alone. But, truth be told, I became used to using that word during depressing times.

And I felt kind of vindicated when I found out that other Christians, like [Micah Murray](http://micahjmurray.com/i-dont-have-my-shit-together), also sometimes use those words!


## The programmer's depressing times

I'm a programmer. 

Debugging is one of the most, if not the most, depressing parts of software development; especially when you are debugging code that someone else wrote.

You read the bug report. 

"That's easy to fix!". 

After 4 hours... depression kicks in. :laughing:

And during depressing times... [you know what happens...](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/03/01/deal-with-legacy-code/)

This should not be the case, right? 

I should be changing already. I should stop being a [hypocrite](https://odb.org/2011/01/26/like-a-hypocrite/).

It took many years for the bad attitude to develop. Maybe it will also take many years to regain the good one.
