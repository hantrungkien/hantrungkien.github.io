I just read from Colossians 3 (v. 14) that "Love is what holds everything together in perfect unity." (ERV)

Love is very powerful, I believe. In the past, I even thought to myself that love might be the most powerful force in the entire universe --- it can change anything. (_Anything_ does not really mean _anything_; maybe _lots of things?_)

But... how to love? That is my question.

<!--more-->

Can we do the _"act the way you want to feel"_ method on this?

That sounds pretentious to me. :laughing:

But what I mean is, "can we _discipline_ ourselves to love?"

Maybe??

Love is a choice<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[1](#footnote-1)</sup>, right? (Paul says, "**_put on_** love")

But, is there an easier method? :grin:

<br />

### PS:

<small>
I believe that the enemy of our Creator has been redefining _terms_ since his rebellion. So you might have a different definition for _love_ than I do.
</small>

<small>
To make the confusion go away, I have to add that the kind of _love_ I am talking about is the one described in I Corinthians 13 of the bible. It was also written by Paul. :smile:

### Footnotes:

<sup id="footnote-1">[1](#footnote-indicator-1)</sup> <small>I can still remember [Dr. Jim Schettler](https://wcbc.edu/academics/faculty/dr-jim-schettler)'s definition for love during one of his sermons aired on Daystar when he was still the pastor of the Campus Church at PCC: </small>
<br />
<blockquote>
<small>
"Love is a choice of the will of finding joy in someone or something. And doing your best for that one without regard to self or cost."
</small>
</blockquote>

If you think you have been _greatly_ influenced by the secular media in the past many years, please note that your definition of the word _love_ might be different from my definition when I used that word above.

If you have no idea what I mean by _love_, please read I Corinthians 13 of the bible. It was also written by Paul. :smile:
