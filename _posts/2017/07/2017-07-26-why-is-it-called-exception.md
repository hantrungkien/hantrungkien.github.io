> "It is called an exception because it is an **exception to what is expected.**"

Those are the words of Dr. Ana Bell in Lecture 7 of [MIT OCW's 6.0001 course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) (at 21:50 minutes through the lecture)
