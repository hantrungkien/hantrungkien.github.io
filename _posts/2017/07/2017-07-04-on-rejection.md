Being rejected hurts so bad. We sometimes ask, "Why does God allow these things to happen?"

But **_what if_** rejection is just part of the normal way things work?

<!--more-->

I mean, we know about the principle of _sowing and reaping._ Some people call it _karma_. We rejected God _(I'm assuming the Christian worldview here :smile:)._ The _sowing and reaping_ principle demands that we also experience rejection and hurt.

**_What if_** it is the case that every human being who have lived past the [innocence stage of a child](https://www.gotquestions.org/age-of-accountability.html), will experience rejection one way or another before death? --- Because we all rejected God! _(I'm assuming the Christian worldview here)._

But someone, in the Psalms, also said that God is so merciful He gives us less than the punishment that we deserve. --- That could mean that the sum of the hurt from all the rejections we experience in this life is far less than the hurt God experienced and experiences from our rejections of him.

And more... [He took upon him our punishment.](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-the-gospel.html)

And **_what if_** the reason why God _permitted_ us to reject him in the first place is because he wants us to have a firsthand experience of what rejection is --- it's effects and the hurt that it brings (when the law of sowing and reaping kicks in) --- so that someday, in eternity, we will never choose to reject him again??

<!--
Remember the Devil? Was he given the kind of test of rejection like we were given? I don't know. But why does it seem that he is incapable of repentance? Does that have something to do with the principle of sowing and reaping? Maybe his capability of rejecting God was so small but he still chose to rebel? --- The greater the rejection you sow, the greater its effect on you?

(Maybe the scope of the principle of sowing and reaping extends beyond the material universe?)
(I'm not trying to say that this principle is beyond God. What I'm trying to say is that this principle might be part of how God works, or part of his character, or something like that.)
