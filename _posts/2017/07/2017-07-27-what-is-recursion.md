### _Recursion?... Perhaps you mean [Recursion](https://www.google.com.ph/search?q=recursion)!?..._ :smile:

> "Recursion is the idea of taking a problem and **reducing** it to a **smaller version** of the **same** problem."
<br /><br />

## _Very hard_... but perseverance can make it _hard_ only, _easy_ even

When i first encountered recursion... 

_"What was that again!?"_... 

It was hard.

Then, when I encountered it again after a few months... 

_"Ok! I think I get it already."_ :+1:

Then, again, after a few months... 

[_"Great!! I can now solve some problems using it!"_](http://jeremiahflaga.blogspot.com/2011/09/recursion-stanfords-cs106b-assignment.html)

If you have an average IQ, like me, I think it's just normal to find recursion hard when we encounter it for the first time. _(If you do not agree with me, you can assume that you have a higher IQ than me :smile:)_

But I believe that after encoutering it many times, it becomes familiar and much easier to understand, just like many other things we know.

**Arithmetic**, for example, was very hard when we first encountered it. But today, it's easy as 1-2-3. :smile:

If you want to learn more about recursion, Prof. Eric Grimson, in Lecture 6 of [MIT OCW's course #6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/), shows examples on using it in solving some problems. He gave recusive solutions to 

1. multiplying numbers, 
2. determining if a string is a palindrome, 
3. the Towers of Hanoi problem, and 
4. solving for the `n`<sup>`th`</sup> Fibonacci number.

Enjoy!
