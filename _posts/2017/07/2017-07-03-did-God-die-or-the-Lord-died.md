I'm confused!

In Cebuano, we often interchange the word "Diyos" and "Ginoo". "Diyos" is "God" in English, and "Ginoo" is "Lord".

So when we try to translate "The Lord died on the cross" into Cebuano, we sometimes say "And Diyos namatay sa krus" --- In English, that is "God died on the cross".

<!--more-->

But I tend not to use the word "Diyos" (or "God") when talking about the death on the cross --- because God does not die, right?

Well, last weekend, we sang the song titled "And Can It Be".

It has this lyrics in the Chorus:

> "Amazing love how can it be, that Thou my God shoulds die for me."

Toinks!

But Dr. James White in his recent debate said that [death is _not the cessation of existence_](https://youtu.be/ZnElgAnN414), so maybe it's still okay to use the word "God" (or "Diyos") when talking about the death on the cross??

[The] Google [search engine, in a sense] is our friend... Let's see if we can find some answers.
