Do you like simple rules?

### Simple rules

I like simple, but/and/yet all-encompassing rules _(partly because I'm not very good at remembering lots of things :smile: ):_

> You can start anywhere.

> "If it sounds good, it is good." --- Duke Ellington

> "Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler." --- Albert Einstein

> If it is hard, it must be wrong.

### Another simple rule

I found another simple rule!

In the introduction videos of the [Nand2Tetris course](put like here to coursera course), Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken calls it _"The Main Secret of Computer Science"_:

> Don't worry about the **"how"**, only about the **"what"**.
<br /><br />
> In other words, don't worry about the "implementation", only about the "abstraction".


Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce, the authors of the [GOOS book](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga), also said something about it (p. 252): 

> All code should emphasize **"what"** it does over **"how"**, including test code.


[Jonathan Boccara]((https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/01/27/respecting-abstraction/)) declared it  as _**"the principle that rules them all"**: respecting levels of abstraction_. 

> ... abstraction is characterized by **what** a particular piece of code intends to do as opposed to **how** it is implemented

### "what" over "how"

Simple, yet all-encompassing rule!

> Focus on the **"what"**, not the **"how"**

Of course we might still be the one to write the _"how" part_. But if we focus on the _"what" part_ when writing code, we will end up with code that is, what they call, **_"intention revealing" code_**.

> "what does this code do?..."
<br /><br />
> "ahhh!"

And **_"intention revealing" code_** is easy to read! Remember that we, and our coleagues _(we should think about our coleagues also :smile:)_ spend _more_ time reading than writing code!

It's also easy to write, I think.


I should put this in mind always then...

_"what" over "how"_

_"what" over "how"_

_"what" over "how"_

_"what" over "how"_

:smile:

**_"what does this button do?"_**
