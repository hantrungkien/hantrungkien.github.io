I got that from the book
["How to Win Friends and Influence People"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780091906818?a_aid=jflaga).
(This book is very dear to me because it helped me change the way I view other
people --- it changed, to a large degree, my cynicism.)

In the same chapter where I got that quote, the book says this:

> "God Himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days."

Ahhh!

Does that mean it is okay to judge people when they are _already dead_?

Okay... Let's do some judging of some dead people!

...

[Helen Gurley Brown](https://albertmohler.com/2012/08/24/why-the-sexual-revolution-needed-a-sexual-revolutionary/)
is dead!

[Hugh Hefner](https://albertmohler.com/2012/08/24/why-the-sexual-revolution-needed-a-sexual-revolutionary/)
is dead!

_We should be celebrating!_

Two less...

Oh! They produced more people much _worse_ than them?

But perhaps those people are not much worse than those two dead people.

They have seen the results of what those two dead people did!

I hope they will already stop propagating the legacy of those two dead people.

If only I were a very intelligent person...

... and knows machine learning,

... and knows how to create a virus,

... and knows how to hack computers,

... and knows many other great things,

... and don't have anything else to do,

... I would create something that will scan all servers and destroy those ones
that needs to be destroyed!

:laughing: :laughing:

_I'm just joking!_

:laughing:

_Or maybe I am not!_

:laughing:

_I'm just joking. Really_ :smile:

But I'm hoping that **someone very intelligent** will do...

Ooops!

I mean...

I heard one hacker in the past who said something like, _"That would be
revenge!"_

:laughing:

_I'm just joking._

:laughing:

_Please don't._

Uncle Bob Martin said that those kinds of acts are unethical or something like
that ---
[dishonorable, he said](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/09/29/TheUnscrupulousMeme.html).

:smile:

_Please don't._

But if you don't care about this _dishonorable thing_...

:laughing:

_I'm just joking!_

:laughing:

_**Why am I blaming other people instead of mastering my own self!**_

:sob:

_Still, they are propagating evil... what can be done about this?_

_It it really dishonorable to get rid of dishonorable things?_

[There is a better way, of course... But it's harder... _(or is it?)..._ But it cures...]
