<!-- November 18, 2017 11:40:00 AM Philippine Time -->

When I was young (about 16 or 17 years old), I remember writing in my notebook something that goes like this:

_(I was aspiring to become a pastor during that time)_

> When you are already a pastor, and you need to make some major decisions, make sure to **also** consult people who are much younger than you, because they might have some ideas that you and the older people failed to consider.


<!--more-->


I think I was able to think that way because, by that time, I already saw multitudes _(not really multitudes, just a few :laughing:; I'm just exaggerating)_ of mistakes that older people had made. Mistakes that will make you say to yourself, _"Why did they do that?"_

_Perhaps they are just too busy, and they did not have time to consider all the implications of a decision?_

_Perhaps they have a different value system than I do? --- What I consider a mistake was not really a mistake to them?_

_Perhaps they have the same value system as I do, but they were driven by a very selfish kind of desire during that time, and they were not able to recognize the selfishness of a decision --- "As long as the goal is met…"?_

_... Or maybe they recognized the selfishness of a decision, but were so weak during that time, and so was not able to resist the temptation?_ 


I'm not sure.


I actually fear that someday, someone will say the same things about some major decisions that I had made.

That is one of the reasons why I read books and articles, most especially those that were written by older and experienced men.

And that is one of the reasons why I like listening to younger people when they talk about their experiences, and their thoughts and ideas, most especially when those thoughts and experiences are related to the field I am involved in today --- software development.


_A very long introduction, right?_

That is not really an introduction. 

That was the whole thing. :smile:

I just decided to write this blog post when I remember the _"consulting younger people" note_ after I read the following from the book ["Apprenticeship Patterns" book by David H. Hoover and Adewale Oshineye _(which is freely available online!)_](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813):

> Ultimately, unleashing your enthusiasm is one of the relatively few responsibilities of the apprentice. You may not bring deep knowledge or hyper-productivity, but **it is your duty to inject some excitement into your team and question everything.** You are in the **unique** (and **temporary**) position of having a fresh perspective, which should allow you to offer some useful suggestions for improvement.
<br />
> > **Craftsmen learn from the apprentices, even as the apprentices learn from them.** Enthusiastic beginners not only renew the craftsmen, but also challenge the craftsmen by bringing in new ideas from the outside. A well chosen apprentice can make even a master craftsman more productive.
<br />
> > --- Pete McBreen, Software Craftsmanship, p. 75

_Wow!_

So _**questioning everying**_ can bring some excitement!?

_Hmmm..._

_Ma-try nga..._
