I don't know who first coined the phrase "god object" but i think it's time for us to refrain from using that phrase already.

If we continue using that phrase, the next generation of programmers might confuse God with "god".

The "god object" is a derogatory phrase. Someone else might (or already are) mistakenly (or rebelliously) use "God" instead of "god" in that phrase and the next generation of programmers might be influenced to think that it's okay to belittle our creator, The Programmer.

Maybe we are thinking that belittling our creator is a cool thing to do!? We will be ashamed of it in the future.
