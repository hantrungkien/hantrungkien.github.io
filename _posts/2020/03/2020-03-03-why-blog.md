Why Blog?

So that we will have something to laugh about when we get older, of course!

:laughing:

> "Write about what you are doing. When you face a tough problem in your work then you find a breakthrough, itâ€™s probably something others will face. Blog about it." - Vaughn Vernon


> "I never know what I think about something until I read what I've written on it." - William Faulkner


> "I write because I don't know what I think until I read what I say." - Flannery O'Connor
