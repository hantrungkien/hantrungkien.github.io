> Superintelligent machines are impossible? So what? It's better to be safe than sorry!



"The technology is not the problem... You don't stop the technology; you monitor our conduct as human beings in the face of it." - Neil deGrasse Tyson


Also, I think that if the majority of people will believe that machines can have a mind of their own, when things involving machines go wrong we can be easily duped by other people who wants us to believe that "it's the machine's fault and not theirs/ours" (I understand that that statement does not prove that machines will never have a mind of their own, but please don't fear AI yet; not today)
