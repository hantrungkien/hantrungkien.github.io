> If it causes pain, it must be bad.

That is one of the most basic assumptions of many (if not all) people, including me, of course.

> If it causes more pain, it must be badder than bad

... or, how do we say it? 

... _"worse"_

> If it causes more pain, it must be worse.

Maybe using the word _"evil"_ is better...

> If it causes pain, then it must be evil.
<br /><br />
> If it causes more pain, then it must be eviler, _I mean_, more evil.

Okay... enough messing around.






My reason for accepting the assumptions of Christianity is that "_they work"_.





And because of that, many people ask the question,

	If God is good (not bad), why does he permit pain and suffering?






But nobody (I think) wants to believe in a cruel god (perhaps because we know in our heart of hearts that the real God must be good). So eventually, those who believe in an "eat-or-be-eaten" kind of universe will rebel against whoever god they believe in --- to the point of denying the existence of any god.




The earlier you do something about the pain, the better.




I recently watched Michael Feather's talk ["The Deep Synergy Between Testability and Good Design"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVZvoFGJTU)









Least amount of pain to least number of people

Of course this assumes that we know what causes pain to people.

I can think of three things we can know what causes pain.

	1. When we experience the pain first hand
	2. When we hear/read other's first-hand experience of it
	3. When the original designer of a system tells us if something causes pain or not.


Because our Designer did not give us a rule book on how to design computer systems (because we do not want him to... because we want to experience everything first-hand, right? :smile: ... Or perhaps because it is not as important as the ones he revealed to us.), we only have two options left.
