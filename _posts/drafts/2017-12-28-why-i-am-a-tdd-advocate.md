... after hearing Uncle Bob's talk on architecture where at the end part of his talk he talked about the benefit of TDD... also the Fitness project .. where he is confident on deploying it if all the tests run... I wan't to be able to do that also



I now understand why I have become a TDD advocate these days... 

It's because I understand the value of automated tests, and because of my previous experience of writing unit tests after the production code is already written --- it was hard :D (it was hard because I'm not yet a Michael Feathers)

I'm a TDD fan even though I never experience doing TDD in a readl world project.


I'm hopeful that TDD will solve many of the problems that programmers are facing.
