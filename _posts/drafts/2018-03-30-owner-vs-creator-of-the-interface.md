In OOP we learn that "the client is the owner of the interface".

But in the book "The Lean Startup", the author says the the client (or the customers) usually does not know what it really needs.

(Am I committing the fallacy of equivocation in here? Perhaps... :smile: Perhaps I'm using the word _"client"_ in two different places while they mean differently in thos two palces. But who cares, right!)

Does that tell us that the client owns the interface but it is not the creator of the interface?

Foolish things :laughing:
