They say that millenials love to travel.

If one travels often, the possibility of being involved (how to say it?) in accidents, (which might be caused by software) becomes high. He might be hit by a self-driving car, or the plane he flies in might crash.

Employers might then be concerned about the projects that that programmer is involved in... what if the programmers dies and we have a deadline... how can someone else be able to get where the dead programmer left off?

[TDD](/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/) of course... (TDD again!?)


<!--more-->

When programmers follow the TDD process when developing software, there is a very big chance of having a 100% test coverage. Of course a 100% coverage does not mean that everything is already okay; but at least the next programmer has tests that he can use to check if what he is doing break something.

But does the employer need another programmer to check whether the programmer he/she hired tried to do something to have 100% test coverage? No of course. He can use Coverage tools... he can sometimes try to change just one line of code at random and see if one of the tests fails... etc
