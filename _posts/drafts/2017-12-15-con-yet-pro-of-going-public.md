TLDR: people will get angry at you for trying to change their minds; but they will eventually love you, when they already changed their minds.



> "Greg, letâ€™s be honest. This post is not about parallel fifths is it? This is about a philosophy. You love to do this. You talk about an technical or theory musical element but really you are trying influence how people think about music. That is not a bad thing unless you are trying to get them to think in a bad way but I have to say that I think much of what you promote is bad."

I got that one from the comments section in [one of Greg Howlett's blog posts](https://greghowlett.com/blog/free-lessons/032112.aspx) which I read a few years ago when I was still very interested with music. (I still am interested, but I have not practiced for years already so my _insignificant-compared-to-others_ skills in music are rusty already :laughing:)

I already forgot how I found Greg Howlett's blog, but I think I was looking for free Christian sheet music online and his materials are one of the results google gave.

I was happy I found his blog and his music tutorials. I really liked his music tutorials. Through his tutorials I learned _basic techniques_ in reharmonization. I even learned a _little bit_ of playing by ear, a skill which I thought was impossible for me to learn. I was encouraged to learn how to play by ear because I heard him say that playing by ear is not a skill given to only a few gifted people (especially those who have perfect pitch). It can be learned. And he gives himself as an example of someone who _learned_ how to play by ear. And he learned how to play by ear after his college years already! (if I remember it correctly)

He also talks about what he calls _proper voicing_, which he said is also very important in music, which I still have to learn how to do of course.

Now, don't be fooled into thinking that I'm a good musician. Far from it. 

But I digress _(I always do this, right --- moving away from my main point?)_... Okay, back to the comment above...

> "... but I have to say that I think much of what you promote is bad."

That comment rings a bell to me because my _old self_ (or my _young self_ I would say) would have made comments similar to that.

You see, when I first learned about Greg Howlett, I did not agree with him on his philosophy on music.
I liked his tutorials so much and was very thankful that someone like him is very willing to share his knowledge for free. But when he talks about his opinions about whether a particular kind of music is bad or good...

"Wow... I think I need to reconsider my position on this..."



If I am allowed to do this, I think we can categorize Two camps:

1. Good or bad music depends on the culture of the people listening and the lyrics of the song, of course...

2. There are absolute rules which determines bad music or good music, regardless of culture and reagardless of the lyrics (we might have not yet discovered the majority of those rules).


Of ourse there is a third one...

3. Good music are those that will make me popular or will make me lots of money

... but who are we to judge other peoples intentions right?



Just look at the history of jazz...

Look at the history of rock and roll...

This is waht I think: If the fall did not happen (if we did not rebel against God), this discovery of musical styles will still happen, all music that will come out of our hearts would be good, the history of jazz would have been good, the history of rock would have been good.

I'm not sure about this.



If the heart is good, whatever kind of music will come out of that heart will be good and will give good influence to others.

If the heart is bad, even a simple chant (which barely has musical elements in it) which that kind of heart produces will be bad and will give bad influence to others.


So instead of focusing on making or discovering rules about which music is bad or good, people should focus on making peoples hearts good if they want these people to create good music.




I have a friend who likes screaming music.

I don't like that kind of music. I think it's bad. I think it gives bad influence to the listeners of the song. But maybe it's a cultural thing.

He was raised in a culture where many people consider screaming music as one of the norms.












people talked bad about spurgeon when he talked against slavery but today he is one of the most celebrated preachers of all time

people supported Neils Bohr about his interpretation in the past but a few today start critisizing him.

people talk about uncle bob, calling him crazy sometimes, but perhaps his prophecy of TDD becoming norm in the future

But these people have their respective supporters and critics during their times.

Like what Greg Howlett says when talking about hymns

> Old hymns which survived have this advantage of time

> These songs being prduced by artists today, many of them will not be sung anymore a decade from now. But those with which people can relate to, those which are good, will be sung for all eternity.

- This is one of Greg's articles (among others) that changed my view on "music standards". (I had a very strict standard before :blush:)
