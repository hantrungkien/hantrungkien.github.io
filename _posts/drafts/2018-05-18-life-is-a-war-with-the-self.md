From the books I recently read and from other materials I recently read/watched from the internet, it seems like our old folks are saying that life is a war with the self;a game with the self!... I'm not sure if I phrased that correctly. But I think you can better understand what I want to say through the quotes below.

and as dr werner gitt pointed out in his talk "In The Beginning was Information" we, humans, are not only a biological system, but is also a system based on information.

And information systems has a "purpose" part in it. Is the purpose of this information system is just to make the builogical system survive? That's a miserable purpose I think.
