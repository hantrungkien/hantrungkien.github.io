A year ago, I was busy listening to Uncle Bob Martin's talks on Clean Architecture, TDD, SOLID, and other things. He is very passionate about promoting TDD, which is a practice he said he doubted when he first heard about it.

Through these talks, I learned that TDD was introduced way back in late 1900s as part of XP.

I also heard Uncle Bob saying that it takes about 20 years for a good idea to spread to the whole community.

The TDD book of Kent Beck was published last 2002. And 20 years has not yet passed since that time. So it's no wonder why TDD has not yet gained widespread acceptance...???

But I digress...

Because of those things I heard from Uncle Bob, one day (it was March 30, 2014 in my notes) I tried to google to confirm the 20 years estimate.

Now, I grew up with.... being influenced by people such as Ken Ham and Jason Lisle.

I found myself in the wikipedia page of "biogenesis" where it says "The hypothesis of biogenesis"

_"What?"_


I heard Dr. Werner Gitt in his talk on Information that there is only one law in biology that we know about, and that is the Law of Biogenesis. (As I understand it, "law" and "theory" are synonymous in science. If I'm wrong, please say so in the comments. :smile:)

Biogenesis even predates Einstein's theory of relativity (not that I know what relativity is :smile:). There are lots of evidences which show that biogenesis is true. And not one is yet shown to falsify it. Why name it an "hypothesis" instead of a "theory"?

(NOTE: check again that experiment of life emerging from non-life)

Ahhh!!!

I think I know what the reason is. Perhaps the reason is this: 

_In our society today, there is a very popular hypothesis about the origin of life. The 'molecule-to-man' kind of evolution_

But perhaps I do not know what I am talking about in here!?

If you think that is so, please say so in the comments, and please include your [better idea] of course. :smile:
