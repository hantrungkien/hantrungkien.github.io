A few months ago I watched "Christopher Hitchens -VS- William Lane Craig - Does God Exist. Science Debate"

William Lane Craig is a very adorable man. He seems to always smile and is happy with his life.



In order to appreciate this point just take a look at the artistic illustrations in Johnny V. Miller and John M. Soden, In the Beginning… We Misunderstood: Interpreting Genesis 1 in Its Original Context (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Kregel Publications, 2012) of what a literalistic understanding of such myths would involve.

All of the non-concordists I have read PRIOR to Miller and Soden, however, tend to note the problems with concordist interpretations ["so," they conclude, "therefore, we must adopt a non-concordist interpretation"], but/and, then, they immediately "get on" with "the science" of the age of the earth . . . and they jettison any concern with or attempt, properly, to interpret the biblical text. I.e., they leave us with an open question as to WHAT WAS THE BIBLE MEANT TO SAY? HOW SHOULD WE INTERPRET IT?

Miller and Soden provide an answer. [And, I will say, a rather satisfying answer. At least it was for me.]

It is an answer that will shake up most fundamentalists' and/or evangelicals' perspectives on the Bible. But I believe Miller and Soden have gotten to the deepest roots of my discomfort with both the old- and young-earthers' claims . . . but/and do so while honoring the text as written, the Bible as God's inerrant Word. They also leave modern science to do whatever it will do.

(In case you are wondering, they say, YES, the Bible--"even" Genesis 1-3--is authoritative. But/and it is authoritative and speaks authoritatively in a way that doesn't happen to have anything to do with the age of the earth or scientific evidence concerning the age of the earth. --As I have expressed elsewhere, in response to another reviewer's comments: Miller and Soden present their case well. I encourage you to read their presentation for the evidence.)
