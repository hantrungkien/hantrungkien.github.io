I said that to myself when I was about 17 years old.

You see, I was raised up in an environment where people believe that the word of God is perfect. And by the "word of God" we mean the Bible, both the Old and New Testatments.

> "The law of the LORD is perfect..." --- from the Psalms

And if you are familiar with the Bible, you might also know that there are lots of Bibles in the world; I mean, there are lots of different versions of the Bible; lots of translations. In English for example, there are these: KJV, RSV, ESV, NASB, NIV, NLB, ERV, BBE, CEV, TLB, etc.

And there are a few passages where they say different things. Compare for instance I John 5:7-8 in KJV and ESV:

> **KJV:**
<br /><br />
1Jn 5:7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
<br />
1Jn 5:8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

> **ESV:**
<br /><br />
1Jn 5:7  For there are three that testify:
<br />
1Jn 5:8  the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.

See the difference?

Either the KJV translators added something to the Bible, or the ESV translators ommitted something from the Bible, right? And adding or ommitting something from the Bible is prohibited in the Bible itself (in Revelation 22:18-19 and Prov 30:6). Tsk tsk!

What's worse, I John 5:7 is one of the verses that is traditionally used to defend the doctrine of the trinity!

Some people regarded this as a very serious matter.
