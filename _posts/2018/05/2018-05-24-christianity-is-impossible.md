I remember saying that to myself many years ago. And what I meant by that is _"the Christian life is impossible to live"._ The standard is too high. I can't live it.

And I think I was right!

<!--more-->

I just read a quote in a facebook post by a facebook friend named Nick Sumaylo. It went like this:

> The Christian life and ministry are not difficult. 
<br />
They're **impossible**.
<br />
...

See?

And if Christianity is impossible, what better thing to do than to leave it!

I wanted to. I tried.

But it seems like Christianity always has an answer to _those_ questions... and my alternative worldview do not.

I have become like the man who said, "Where else can we go? You are the source of life."

But I was right! It truly is impossible...

> The Christian life and ministry are not difficult. 
<br />
They're **impossible**.
<br />
They are supernatural life and ministry.
<br />
And you cannot live a supernatural life, you cannot engage in a supernatural ministry by natural means alone.
<br />
Everything coming from God, NOTHING from you and me is the secret to Christian life and ministry. Watch the danger of a misplaced confidence!

Tsk tsk!

It is impossible.
