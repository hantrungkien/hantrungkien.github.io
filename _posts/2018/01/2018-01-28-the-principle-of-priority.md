While browsing through my notes on The War of Art of Steven Pressfield, I found this:

> I'm keenly aware of the Principle of Priority, which states
(a) you must know the difference between what is **urgent** and
what is **important**, and (b) you must do what's important first.

I heard a similar statement from Uncle Bob in chapter two of Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design.

> ...Those things that are urgent are not very often of great importance. And those things that are important are seldom of great urgency.
<br /><br />
> The first value of software — **behavior — is urgent** but not always particularly important.
<br /><br />
> The second value of software — **architecture — is important** but not particularly urgent.

I think this is one of those very important principles in life... I think it is on the same level as the principle of sowing and reaping.


So I created a separate page for quotes regarding this "important vs. urgent" idea.

Here it is: [Important vs. Urgegent](/memorabilia/quotes/important-vs-urgent/)
