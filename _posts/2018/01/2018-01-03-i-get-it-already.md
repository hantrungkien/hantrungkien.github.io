Each software development team is different from the other. What works in one team might not work in another.

Each team must agree to some set of [values](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/06/17/IsTddDeadFinalThoughts.html) when working on a project.

A team must make a new participant agree to their set of [values](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2016/10/15/551B3828CD47198C7C5A58903228DA71.html).

A new member of a team must agree with the team's existing set of [values](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/09/06/I-am-Your-New-CTO.html).

I'm a [TDD fan](/quotes/tdd). But [many others are not](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/02/ProfessionalismAndTDD.html).

<!--more-->

And I have never been in a team which practices TDD, but the apps I was and am involved in are working just fine... I hope :smile:! (Actually they were not very fine if we use [Uncle Bob Martin's standards](/memorabilia/videos/expecting-professionalism-by-uncle-bob-martin/#expectations) as our measure, but I'm not going to incriminate myself or my teammates here :grin:)

So when it comes to TDD, I'm negotiable. I'm not a TDD fanatic --- at least not yet :laughing:. But let me experience TDD... I believe I'm never going back... [I hope...](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/04/30/When-tdd-does-not-work.html) :smile:

But there's one thing I don't want to be negotiable on anymore (when I will be involved in a software project from the very start). And that is the [proper separation of the business rules from the other parts of a software system](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/), and taking proper care of them.

The business rules are the most important part of a software system. They are very important to the business people we work for; they must also be very important to us --- even [more important than the frameworks and databases that we love](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html). Uncle Bob Martin said that we must treat them as, what he calls, _"family jewels"_.


But... still... I long for the day when TDD (or anything similar to it) will become a common practice of software developers.

I long for the day when all software systems will look the same --- when they will all look [**_"testable"_.**](/2017/12/19/tdd-and-teaching-design-without-a-teacher) :smile: That means that the software systems will be easy to work with! _Yehey!_


_(I actually have a secret agenda for helping promote the [proper separation of the business rules from the other parts of a software system](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/) --- when I will become a part of a team that do not practice TDD, I will still do TDD with the business rules :smiling_imp:)_
