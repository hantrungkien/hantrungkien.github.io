Following what [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/) is doing, I will start listing the books that I read at the end of each year...


### ["Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests" (GOOS)](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga) by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce

<img src="/images/2017/growing-oo-software-guided-by-tests-book.jpg" height="250" title="GOOS image" alt="GOOS image">

Learned about what they call Outside-In TDD (Or [London School of TDD](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/the-london-school-of-test-driven-development/) as what Emily Bache calls it) --- writing both End-to-End tests (also called functional tests or acceptance tests by others) and writing unit tests at the same time.

(Secret: I skipped some chapters in Part III because there are lots of code already and I find it hard to follow. I only wanted to glean general ideas during the time that I read this. But this book is a classic, so I'm going to read this again... later...)

### [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html) (first seven chapters only)

<img src="https://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920029533/cat.gif" height="250">

Same idea presented in [GOOS](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga) --- Outside-In TDD. But this is more of a tutorial-for-beginners kind of book, so it is easier to follow than [GOOS](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga).


<!-- 
Some chapters of [24 Deadly Sins of Software Security](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780071626750?a_aid=jflaga)
 -->


### ["Computer Science Distilled"](https://www.bookdepository.com/Computer-Science-Distilled-Wladston-Ferreir-Filho-Raimondo-Pictet/9780997316025?a_aid=jflaga) by Wladston Filho

<img src="/images/2017/computer-science-distilled.png" height="250">



### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.bookdepository.com/Working-Effectively-with-Legacy-Code-Michael-Feathers/9780131177055?a_aid=jflaga) by Michael Feathers (only the first eight chapters for now, and chapter 16)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1311/9780131177055.jpg" height="250">

The authors of GOOS recommended this book.

Also, I heard/read Martin Fowler said that books like this one is very important because most programmers do not go to software development jobs and be involved in starting new projects. Most software projects out there are in the maintenance phase. Books like this is very valuable to programmers involved in these kinds of projects.



### [Clean Architecture](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Architecture-Robert-C-Martin/9780134494166?a_aid=jflaga) (Rough Cuts - September 2016) by Robert C. Martin (using Safari Books Online)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1344/9780134494166.jpg" height="250">

You can also learn the things presented here in Uncle Bob's blog posts and talks on Clean Architecture. But a book is more structured and complete, of course.



### [The Clean Coder](https://www.bookdepository.com/Clean-Coder-Robert-C-Martin/9780137081073?a_aid=jflaga) by Robert C. Martin (using Safari Books Online)

<img src="https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/1370/9780137081073.jpg" height="250">

Uncle Bob Martin experienced being fired from work when he was still young!



### Free version of [Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge](http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SquareOne_PDF.pdf) by Steve Patterson

<img src="http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SquareOneSmall.jpg" height="250">

Philosophy...



### Free version of [What's the Big Deal About Bitcoin?](http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WhatsTheBigDealAboutBitcoin.pdf) by Steve Patterson

<img src="http://steve-patterson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/BitcoinBookCover_V2Small.jpg" height="250">



### Lampara Books Illustrated Classics Collection's "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens, condensed by [Ma. Renita Diano Ramos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marenitadianoramos/)

This is actually a book for children which I saw at National Bookstore. I just became interested with this because I saw this "A Tale of Two" phrase from [one of Eddie Bush's articles](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/clean-architecture-a-tale-of-two-stories/) and from chapter two of Uncle Bob Martin's book "Clean Architecture" --- The title of chapter two was "A Tale of Two Values". I was curious about the the origin of this "Tale of Two" phrase.

A very good story. It is about sacrifice... for someone you love, perhaps... for freedom... for a better future... for the next generation... Yes! The reason why this story is a classic.

----------

Only a few books huh!?

And I did not finish some of the books (at least not yet)... Well, I have not yet formed the habit of goal-setting and sticking to that goal until it is finished. I'm still at the phase where my mind is still wandering from one thing to another without finishing the former first. The first week, _"I have to do SICP"_... The second week, _"I need to concentrate on Android development because that is the platform I am currently working on"_... The third week, _"I need to finish Nand2Tetris... because it is foundational"_... The next week, _"No... the talks of Uncle Bob Martin and Mark Seeman are also foundational"_... Another week, "I have to review ASP.NET because I need to find a job using my knowledge on that"... "You have to learn network programming"... "You have to do The Craftsman Series first!"... "You need to learn F#"... "You need to read How to Win Friends and Influence People again"...

Tsk! tsk!
