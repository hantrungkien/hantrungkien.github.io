(Just a thought regarding the discipline of TDD --- _TDD from the perspective of a hopeful inexperienced TDD advocate_... :smile: This _might_ help convince others to accept TDD)


When we do TDD, we are acknowledging that **we are not perfect beings**...

--- That we might be wrong... and that someone else _(in the future perhaps)_ is able to correct that wrong _(that someone might still be you --- **the better future you!**)_. And that by doing TDD, we are just making a way to make the work of that someone _(which could be you)_ much easier and faster.

--- That there might be a better way of doing things, an optimized way... and that someone else knows about the better way _(in the future perhaps, and that someone might still be you --- **the better future you!**)_. And that by doing TDD, we are just making a way to make the work of that someone _(which could be you)_ much easier and faster.

_Happy coding!!!_
