I do not call myself a software _engineer_, even though many other programmers call themselves software engineers, because the _"real"_ :grin: engineers might become angry with me. :laughing: ... because engineers study lots of maths, and it seems like programming do not really require mastery in lots of maths...

But I recently found someone who says that we, programmers, are engineers! --- --- [Glenn Vanderburg](http://vanderburg.org/blog/2018/01/10/real_software_engineering.html), in his talk ["Real Software Engineering".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhdlBHHimeM)

In the talk, he stated his view on software development as _engineering_:

> Software development already is an engineering field. It always has been.

> We don't need to become engineers; we need to continue to refine our own engineering discipline (as all engineers do).


This is his definition of _"software engineering"_ (in about 48:50 min in the [video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhdlBHHimeM)

> Software engineering is the **science and art** of **designing and making**, with **economy and elegance**, systems so that they can readily adapt to the situations to which they may be subjected.
<br /><br />
> (There is always tension; there is always balance that needs to be resolved situationally and by taste and care...)


Then he continued and gave a picture of a flawed analogy of software engineering with traditional engineering disciplines:

--- a structural engineer --- > produces a design in document form --- > that is then handed to laborers --- > which go build the structure ---

Then he went on to say that this way of doing things in software development never really worked very well...


Then he rebuilt the analogy in a way that works...

We, programmers, are engineers!...

And **our code is the design document!!!** (He also said that the code is not the only design document --- but it is **the detailed design document!**)

:open_mouth:

He then went on and explained that the practices in XP (eXtreme Programming) are a great path to "Real Software Engineering"...
