I started viewing James Shore's "Let's Play TDD" series.


then... in episode 2


<!--more-->

Watching other programmers code, with the purpose of copying their coding style if they look good to me :smile:, is one of the reasons why I liked the idea of pair programming when I first heard it.

... because I think I am a good imitator

... and I believe that imitating masters in a field, whether in music, programming, any field, is part of becoming like our masters and even becoming better than them.




And he said "...I'm not going to figure that out now"..

How is he able to do that?

TDD, perhaps?
