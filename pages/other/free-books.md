<sup id="footnote-1">[[1]](#footnote-indicator-1)</sup> <small>In one of his talks, Martin Fowler said this:</small>

This is my way of contributing to making our world a better place...

I am advocating for the legal distribution of books online (and of course against the illegal distribution of books online :smile: ). And because of that, I will put here links to some freely available books to help those who need books but cannot afford to buy those that are for sale...
</small>

> <small>If we can't legally posses it, it might not be for us (or at least not yet --- there are other things we might need to focus our attention to), or there might be other resources available to us that we are ignoring.</small>
