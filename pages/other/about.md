I'm Jeremiah Flaga, also known as Jboy.

I am software developer and loves programming!

I would also like to love mathematics, computer science, music, philosophy, and theology, but it seems like they don't have time for me today. Maybe someday they will!! --- a hundred years from now perhaps?? :grin:

I am currently employed by [Mynd Consulting](http://www.myndconsulting.com/), a software development company based in Davao City, Philippines. You might want to contact them for your software needs! _(Please note that the views being presented in this site, including those in my [personal blog](/blog/), are mine alone, and do not represent the views being held by my employer or my coleauges.)_
