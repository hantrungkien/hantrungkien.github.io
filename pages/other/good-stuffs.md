### Architecture & Design

["A Little Architecture"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> "The important decisions that a Software Architect makes are the ones that allow you to **NOT** make the decisions about the database, and the webserver, and the frameworks."



The [SOLID Principles](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oar-T2KovwE?list=PLC9xJAJbCB0s7BFxKtFDwQZb3IxEUjzT7) of Software Design

["The Clean Architecture"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/09/30/Screaming-Architecture.html) model of Uncle Bob Martin ([blog](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/11/22/Clean-Architecture.html) [posts](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nsjsiz2A9mg), and book)

> "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the manpower required to build and maintain the required system."

["Respecting Levels of Abstraction"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/01/27/respecting-abstraction/) by Jonathan Boccara


> "I deem respecting the levels of abstraction to be the **most important principle in programming**, because it automatically implies many other best practices.

> "abstraction is characterized by **what** a particular piece of code **intends to do** as opposed to **how** it is implemented"

<!--
> "A given level of abstraction is characterized by **what** is done in it."
<br /><br />
> "When we move from a higher level of abstraction to a lower one, the execution of the tasks in the less abstract level is **how** we implement the more abstract level."


> "I deem respecting the levels of abstraction to be the most important principle in programming, because it automatically implies many other best practices.
<br /><br />
"If you think about this principle when designing your code and constantly ask yourself the question, **“In terms of what am I coding here?”**, your code will flow naturally, perform its function well, and be a pleasure to use for the other programmers and developers who have to work with it.
<br /><br />
"By identifying what things the code does and replacing each one with a label, we know how to raise levels of abstraction in order to make code more expressive."

["Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780321503626?a_aid=jflaga) by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce

> "All code should emphasize **‘what’** it does over **‘how’**, including test code."


["The Most Important Design Guideline"](/2017/06/03/most-important-design-guideline-of-scott-myers/) of Scott Myers
> "Make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly."


["The Right Attitude to Deal with Legacy Code"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2017/03/01/deal-with-legacy-code/) by Jonathan Boccara

> "... **consider that the code you’re working on is your code**. Even if you haven’t written it yourself, and regardless of how good or bad you think it is, this is your code, and you have responsibility over it."




["Don’t Get Obsessed With Design Patterns"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2016/06/15/dont-get-obsessed-design-patterns/) by Joel Rodriguez

> "I believe that knowing object-oriented design principles and applying best practices like SOLID, KISS and YAGNI are far more important than design patterns themselves. If you apply these principles, **patterns will come out naturally**."



### On Learning

["Don’t Overwhelm Yourself Trying to Learn Too Much"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2014/06/23/dont-overwhelm-trying-learn-much/) by John Sonmez

> "I think the best way to improve your skills and to learn what you need to do is to do the learning as close to the time you need the information as possible –- **just-in-time learning**."


["Staying relevant as a programmer"](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/staying-relevant-as-a-programmer-e9f18b1b0e43) by Mattias Petter Johansson or MPJ

> "Are we forever cursed to do this constant tooling rodeo, where we try to hold on in the job market for dear life, learning new tools as the plop up all over the place?
<br /><br />
"Instead of trying to predict the future, which we humans are really bad at — just look at sci-fi movies from the 60-ies — **you should learn the stuff that doesn’t change around a lot**.
<br /><br />
"Learn the fundamentals that we figured out in the 70s and that have been true since. Learn programming in *general*. Don’t be better Angular programmer, or even a better JavaScript programmer — just be a better programmer, period."


["Three Paradigms"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/12/19/Three-Paradigms.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> ...**But in that same 40 years software technology has barely changed at all.** After all, we still write the same if statements, while loops, and assignment statements we did back in the ’60s. If I took a programmer from 1960 and brought him forward through time to sit at my laptop and write code; he’d need 24 hours to recover from the shock; but then he’ll be able to write the code. **The concepts haven’t changed that much.**



["This Is How We Do It"](https://terencemcghee.com/Articles/Tech/2015/10/25/A0B2606228759D1A888E0AFFDB9DADE0.html) by Terence McGhee

> "**The key to growing in this occupation is to realize that neither the languages that you love or the frameworks that you’re familiar with are the keys to your success.** Because the field is so new and because the core fundamentals of programming today are almost exactly what they were from the beginning (Sequence, Selection, and Iteration), **your ability to advance is not hinged on language particulars or framework features**." 



[Please Don't Learn to Code](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html) by Jeff Atwood

> "Software developers tend to be software addicts who think their job is to write code. But it's not. Their job is to solve problems. Don't celebrate the creation of code, celebrate the creation of solutions."

### TDD

[Some TDD Quotes](/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/)

<!--

[So... You want your code to be maintainable](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/so-you-want-your-code-to-be-maintainable) by Uncle Bob Martin

> "**Nothing makes a system more flexible than a suite of tests.** Nothing. Good architecture and design are important; but the effect of a robust suite of tests is an order of magnitude greater. It’s so much greater because those tests enable you to improve the design.
<br /><br />
> "This can’t be overstated. If you want your systems to be flexible, write tests. If you want your systems to be reusable, write tests. If you want your systems to be maintainable, write tests.
<br /><br />
"And write your tests using the Three Laws of TDD."


[TDD Harms Architecture](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/03/TDD-Harms-Architecture.html) by Uncle Bob Martin

> "The idea that the high level design and architecture of a system emerge from TDD is, frankly, absurd. **Before you begin to code any software project, you need to have some architectural vision in place. TDD will not, and can not, provide this vision.** That is not TDD’s role."


Joshua Kerievsky (of Refactoring to Patterns)

> "Test-driven development and continuous refactoring, two of the many excellent XP practices, have dramatically improved the way I build software. 
<br /><br />
>" I’ve found that these two practices have helped me and the organizations I’ve worked for **spend less time over-engineering and under-engineering** and more time creating high-quality, function-rich code, produced on time." -  


Michael Feathers (of Working Effectively with Legacy Code)

> "**Code without tests is bad code.** It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't
matter how pretty or object-oriented or wellencapsulated it is.
<br /><br />
> "With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse."
