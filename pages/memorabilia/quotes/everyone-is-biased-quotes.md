First things first...

I'm a _biased_ person, and a part of my set of biases is this: **_"everyone is biased"_**, including you and me.<sup id="footnote-indicator-1">[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup> That means that my being biased is consistent with one of my set of biases. If you say that you are _neutral_, then that is already proof that you are _biased_ because you already stated your disagreement with me (and with many others who believe that everyone is biased).  :grinning:

On some issues, I think my set of biases on that issue is the best, [so I hold on to them tightly. But I'm still learning.](https://simpleprogrammer.com/2012/09/16/have-strong-convictions-but-hold-on-to-them-loosely/) I might change my mind on some issues later if I will be convinced that my set of biases are wrong.

This page contains quotes about this _"everyone is biased"_ thing.

I created this page because I believe that this _everyone is biased_ idea is very valuable. I think that when people understand that _everyone is biased_, it helps us be more [empathetic](http://chadfowler.com/2014/01/19/empathy.html) of other people... because it will give us hope... that if we will just dig deep into learning about the _biases_ of other people, we can be able to understand them more deeply, and might be able to find techniques in changing their minds (if we want to) in a peaceful and rational kind of way.


### Here are the quotes:

> **It is not a matter of whether one is biased or not. It is really a question of which bias is the best bias with which to be biased.**
<br /><br />
> Occasionally people are upset when dogmatic statements are made. They say, "You cannot be dogmatic like that." This in itself is a dogmatic statement. Many think that some people are dogmatic and others are not. **It is not a matter of whether you are dogmatic or not, but of which dogma is the best dogma with which to be dogmatized!**
<br /><br />
> --- Ken Ham (from ["The Lie: Evolution"](https://answersingenesis.org/christianity/christianity-is-under-attack/))

> Most people today have not given much thought to their own worldview. In fact, many people do not even realize they have a worldview. Many people tend to think that all knowledge is acquired by unbiased observation of the evidence around us. This view is called "empiricism" and is itself a kind of worldview. We cannot help but have some beliefs about how the world works, how we attain knowledge, and how we should live. **Even if we believe that we have no such beliefs --- this is itself a belief. So there's no escaping it. A worldview is inevitable.** A rational worldview is not.

> --- Jason Lisle (from ["The Ultimate Proof of Creation"](https://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780890515686?a_aid=jflaga))

> When it comes to the political and cultural left and right in this country, it’s not that on one side there are those who want to control information and those on the other side who do not; it’s all a matter of what kind of information which side wants to control. When it comes to this kind of question judgmentalism is found everywhere; it’s just a question of who’s making the judgment and what kind of judgment one is making.

> "If you don't know something about apples to begin with, you can't devise a method for separating them.
And in the same way, if you don't know something about the universe to begin with, if you don't know something about reality to begin with, if you don't know something about the difference between truth and error about the universe to begin with, you cannot devise a method that separates the true conclusions from the false conclusions about reality."
<br /><br />
You can't even devise an epistemology --- an apple sorting machine --- unless you already know something about reality; unless you already know something about the apples to begin with.
<br /><br />
"**Everyone begins with a worldview.** Everyone begins with a certain view about reality. And in terms of that perception, that conception of reality, you devise your epistemology ---  your theory of knowledge --- and so neutrality is indeed impossible."
<br /><br />
> --- Greg Bahnsen (from his lecture on "The Myth of Neutrality")


----------


> Part 1 of Dr. Greg Bahnsen’s video lecture series, Basic Training For Defending the Faith, is titled "The Myth of Neutrality." The title sums up the lesson succintly: neutrality is a myth. In this lecture, **Dr. Bahnsen teaches that the idea of neutrality --- be it intellectual, philosophical, emotional, scientific, or in any other area --- is a myth**. You see and read several passages of Scripture that prove this. Jesus spoke definitively about this (Matthew 6:24, Matthew 12:30).
<br /><br />

----------


> The myth of neutrality applies to all levels of reasoning, even in matters that one would consider trivial or surface level.
<br /><br />

----------


> Since everyone has a worldview, everyone has a bias. All of us are naturally biased toward our own worldviews, and all of us tend to interpret and evaluate the world in accordance with our worldviews. So do I have a bias? Yes of course ---  but so do you!
<br /><br />
> **The real issue isn't whether we have biases --- we all do --- but whether we're aware of them and able to think critically about them.**
<br /><br />
> --- from the Introduction of "What's Your Worldview" by James N. Anderson


----------


> Each of us tend to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. **We see the world, not as it is, but as we are --- or, as we are conditioned to see it**...
<br /><br />
> This does not mean that there are no **facts**. [There are] facts. But each person's **interpretation** of these facts represents prior experiencesk and the facts have no meaning whatsoever apart from the interpretation.
<br /><br />
> The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions,... the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view.
<br /><br />
> --- from the "Inside-Out" chapter of "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen R. Covey

## Other quotes which might not be _directly_ related to this "biased" thing, but might still be related...

> "I believe that **we need to have our theories prior to our interpretation of the facts**."
<br /><br />
"Theories are eyeglasses and we put that for us to be able to read."
<br /><br />
"Without theory there is a bunch of data but I can't make any sense out of it.
Theory allow me to then interpret that data and make sense of it."
<br /><br />
> --- Dr. Peter Boettke (from Steve Patterson's "Ep. 13 - Austrian Economics_ Deduction, Logic, and Theory")

    My thought process is heavily influenced by Christian evengelicalism and most quotes in this page are coming from Christian evangelicals.
    <br /><br />
    Of course, I'm not saying that I agree with the poeple I quote _on everything_. What I am saying is that today, I agree with them on this _one_ thing.
    <br /><br />
    Today, year 2018, I am still convinced that _everyone is biased_. That might change in the future, of course. I don't know...
    <br /><br />
    But if you disagree with this _"everyone is biased"_ thing, I would like to hear your arguments. Please tell me about it in the comments section of this page. :+1:
