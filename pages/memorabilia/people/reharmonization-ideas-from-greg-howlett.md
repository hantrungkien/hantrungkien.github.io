[Greg Howlett](http://www.greghowlett.com/default.aspx?affid=5114) is a Christian concert pianist and recording artist.

I have watched many of his [free video lessons and blog posts on reharmonization](http://greghowlett.com/free-piano-lessons-and-arrangements-for-pianists?affid=5114).

Listed below are some of the reharmonization ideas I got from him.

1. A ii chord substitues for a V chord (and a IV chord).

2. A iii chord substitutes for a I chord.

3. A vi chord substitues for a I chord or a V chord.

4. Change V-I cadences into ii-V-I cadences.

5. Insert a minor 5 (v) and dominant 1 (I7) in front of a 4 (IV) chord

6. A dominant chord usually resolves down a fifth or sometimes a half step.

7. Very often, if a progression is moving with the circle of fifths, you can change one of the normal minor chords to major (making it a secondary dominant).

8. Add a flat 9th to secondary dominants if resolving to a minor chord.

9. minor 7 chords likes to resolve down a fifth or in diatonic steps.

10. You can insert a diminished chord betweet 4 and 5 chords.

11. You can substitue a sharp4 dim - minor4 6th - minor 3 - flat3 dim - ii7 - V7 -I for a V-I cadence.

12. Which color note belong to each chord?
<br /><br />
Major/Major 7th
9, #11, 13 (9 is the most common)
<br /><br />
Minor 7th
9, 11, 13 (9 is the most common)
<br /><br />
Dominant
b9, 9, #9, #11, b13, 13 (All are widely used. However, you are most likely to use b9, 9, b13, and 13.)



Here is a sample of his free video lessons: ["Relating harmony to melody"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Pe84XfaNQ)
