> **You can't stand to be alone with yourself because you weren't created to be alone.** Whether you realize it or not, you possess a deep desire to experience a One-to-one connection with the Creator of the universe. God made you that way; it's simply part of who you are. It's woven into your DNA.
<br /><br />
> But if you're like most men, you discovered a long time ago that finding lasting fellowship with the Creator isn't easy. Why? Because you're not only wired to need a relationship with God, **you're also hardwired to want things your own way**.
<br /><br />
> ...
<br /><br />
> To crack the ManCode, **you've got to decide who's in charge: you or God**.


----------


> If you don't develop a strong relationship with God, the rest of your life will be more difficult. A relationship with God doesn't guarantee riches and success, but it does guarantee a balanced and fulfilled life.

> If you distance yourself from the Creator, somebody always gets hurt, and that somebody is always you.

> Want an easy-to-use, highly reliable, readily available antidote to stress? It's called prayer...


----------


> Whether you know it or not, you need a very short list of guys with whom you can talk about anything.

> It takes a strong man to give someone else access to his life.

> A solid inner circle can help you sharpen you skills and focus your thoughts.

> Negative thoughts are habit forming; thankfully, so are positive thoughts. With practice --- and with a little help from your closest comrades --- you can form the habit of focusing on God's priorities and your own possibilities.

> If you do your part today, the future has a way of taking care of itself.


----------


> Jesus didn't isolate himself in the relative safety of a few like-minded believers. Far from it. Christ extended himself to Jews and Gentiles, to rich and poor, to sinners and saints. If it was good enough for him, it's good enough for you.


----------


> (purpose of going to church) You should go to church to grow and to give.

> If your church allows you to continue growing in your faith --- and if you've found a place where you can enthusiastically give of your talents, your treasure, and your time --- you're worshiping at the right place.

> You won't get much out of any church unless you're willing to give something to that church (and the something we're talking about here is not necessarily money).

> The only way you'll really be satisfied in a church is to be a contributing member of your church.

> No church is perfect because every church is comprised of imperfect people. In fact, every church gets a little dysfunctional at times because its members are a little dysfunctional at times too.


----------


> God's tug is not a push. He will not force you to do something against your will.

> God's tug always leads you to do something for others, not for yourself.


----------


> Choices. You must make hundreds of them every day, thousands every week, hundreds of thousands every year. But only one choice will determine your destiny on earth and throughout eternity. That choice, simply stated, is this: what will you decide to do about Jesus?

> When in doubt, consult your Bible. A great place to start is the book of Proverbs.


----------


> Knowledge is horizontal.
<br />
> Wisdom is vertical; it comes down from above.
<br /><br />
> --- Billy Graham


> If you lack knowledge, go to school.
<br />
> If you lack wisdom, get on your knees.
<br /><br />
> --- Vance Havner


> Have thy tools ready; God will find thee work.
<br /><br />
> --- Charles Kingsley


> It is a remarkable thing that some of the most optimistic and enthusiastic people you will meet are those who have been through intense suffering.
<br /><br />
> --- Warren Wiersbe


> If we only believe and ask, a full measure of God's grace is available to any of us.
<br /><br />
> --- Charles Swindoll
