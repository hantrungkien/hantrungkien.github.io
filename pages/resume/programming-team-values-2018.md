Each member must always have the goal of separating the business rules from the other parts of the system.


Someone who is already familiar with the system must guide closely a newly hired developer, even to the point of doing pair programming with them on their first few tasks. Through this, the new developer will get familiar with the system much quickly.

This will also help ingrain in the mind of the new developer that the project he is involved in is not a joke and that his teammates care about the project and about him.




A team member must be honest to tell the team that he is stuck when he is stuck and the team members must be willing to help the stuck member.



Anybody in the team must be allowed to give suggestions as to how to better do something

Anybody in the team must have the permission to point out if the team is doing something wrong, and the team must do something to correct that wrong if it truly is wrong, or to convince his teammate that it is not wrong.
