I already resigned from my current job because the project I am currently involved in is almost finished (I will be leaving in the end of February 2018) so please don't be alarmed about this "open application letter" thing. I promise that when I get hired at your company, I will not be entertaining job offers from other companies while I'm still employed at your company. :smile:

And as you might have already known (based on experience), people who have less experience about things are often the most excited about them. So, be cautious... because you (or someone else in your team) might consider me [a phony](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx), depending on your current skillset.

If you want to have a better way of measuring whether I'm [a phony](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx) or not, please see my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/) and [anti-r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/anti-resume/). :smile:

<h2 id="design-guide">
  <strong>(a) Design Guide</strong>
</h2>

_(By "design" I mean "software design".)_

> The important decisions that a Software Architect makes are the ones that allow you to **NOT** make the decisions about the database, and the webserver, and the frameworks.
<br /><br />
--- Uncle Bob Martin (from ["A Little Architecture"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html))


I'm not saying that I'm already an expert on design, but I'm doing my best to become one. If no one else is willing to hold this kind of role in your company, I would like to volunteer to hold this role.

I have chosen this role, _"Design Guide"_, to be one of the primary roles I want to apply for in your company because one of the things I want to do as a software developer is to make a software system maintainable through the [separation of the business logic part from the other parts of the software system.](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/)

I prefer to be in this role when working on a new project, of course _(everybody wants to work on new projects :grin:)_. But I can also hold this role on projects that are in the maintenance phase.

If I am hired to have this role on a **new** project, what I will do is _help_ in deciding how to structure the entire system so that the _"business rules"_ part of the system will be separated from the other parts of the system. I believe that separating the business rules is very important if you want your system to be maintainable. 

If the "business rules" are separated from the other parts of the system, it will be easy for _new_ programmers to fix bugs and add new features, even when the original designers of the system is not present anymore. And if the new programmers find a business rule that they do not understand, they can just ask the business owner about it (when the original programmers of the system are not present anymore).

<!-- 
So this separation thing will be helpful mostly during the maintenance phase of the system, especially when the original developers of the system are not working on that project anymore... because programmers cannot use google to search about the business rules of a business. They can google for things like how to use a certain framework, but they cannot google for the business rules. They can ask the business owners about them, they can ask someone who is already familiar with the system, but they cannot google for them.
 -->

Then, after deciding on the structure of the entire system, when the actual coding of the features already start, I will pair program with those assigned to do the more complex features of the system and _help_ them with how to design their code. Then when the features that require design guidance are all finished, I will just work on my own in coding the other features.

If I am hired to have this role on an **existing** project (in maintenance phase), what I will do is to get familiar with the system by working with the team on fixing bugs and adding new features on the system for a few (or many) weeks. Then when I am already familiar with the system, I will _help_ on _slowly_ separating the business rules from the other parts of the system, starting with those tasks which involves adding new features or functionalities. Please note that I used the word _help_ in that sentence because I will be needing lots of _help_ from someone who is already familiar with the system while doing this work. I believe I can also do this alone but it will cost me (and you) lots of time and lots of frustration.

But you might already have a Design Guide in your company. If that is the case, I would like to apply as a [Design Partner](#design-partner).

<h2 id="design-partner">
  <strong>(b) Design Partner</strong>
</h2>

> Two is better than one.

Software design/architecture is a laborious work. If your software designer is doing all the work alone, he might easily get tired, or get bored, and might make some bad decisions about the system. I can help him on that. I can be able to point out if I think something is bad. He can help me with my decisions also. He can be able to point out if I make something bad.

_(I am assuming here that your designer considers the business rules to be the most important part of the software system, of course, and that it must be [separated from the other parts of the system](http://craftsmanshipcounts.com/policy-mechanism-preservation-business-value/).)_

Perhaps you have someone in your team a very good sofware designer, or a budding designer, and you want to keep him for the next years to come. One way of doing that, I think, is to give him a design partner, because he might get stuck sometimes, or feel unmotivated sometimes, or feel like abandoning his disciplines just to solve a problem quickly, and he needs someone to talk to or share his ideas with. I can be that someone.

<h2 id="design-apprentice">
  <strong>(c) Design Apprentice</strong>
</h2>

Your software designer might be _lots-of-years-ahead_ of me, and being a [Design Partner](#design-partner) does not seem appropriate for the role that he (or your company) needs... I can become his _apprentice_ instead.

Or perhaps your software designer is leaving in a few years and he is looking for an apprentice to train... I can become his apprentice. :smile:

<h2 id="thinking-rubber-duck">
  <strong>(d) A Thinking Rubber Duck</strong>
</h2>

Some of our master programmers advise us to bring with us a rubber duck in the office, and try to explain to that rubber duck our problem when we feel like we are stuck with that problem, because this can help us solve the problem.

But many programmers do not do that because they are afraid that their coleagues might think that they are being an idiot talking to a rubber duck.

I can replace that rubber duck instead. Some programmers sometimes need to talk to someone who can **_think with them_** and _help_ them solve the problem when they are stuck. I can be that programmer who anyone can call anytime they are stuck.

Also, through this role, I can become familiar with the whole system and might someday help with bringing the code into a state where the business rules are separated from the other parts of the system, or to bring it into a state of being testable.

If you read my [Anti-r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/anti-resume/#not-an-expert-on-frameworks), you might already know that I'm not an expert on frameworks (but I intend to be, if time permits).

In the .NET world, some of the frameworks I have experience working with (but far from being an expert in) are:

- Windows Forms
- Windows Presentation Foundation
- ASP.NET Web Forms
- ASP.NET MVC
- ASP.NET Web API
- ADO.NET
- Entity Framework
- StructureMap
- Moq
- (etc.)

**I'm even rusty on some of them today** because I became an Android Developer in my last job. And in the last year or so, I moved my focus into learning software design rather than on frameworks and languages. So if I will be hired as a .NET developer, I might need some time to re-familiarize myself with the specific frameworks and libraries that are being used in the app that I will be involved in.

Also, I prefer to be involved in the Web API part of the system, because I'm not very good with the UI part of a software system. (Did you notice that I put Bootstrap instead of CSS in my [r&eacute;sum&eacute;](/resume/)?)

But if your Web API team is full already, or if the role that I need to fill will still involve the UI, such as in an ASP.NET MVC project, then I have to push myself to be good at the UI also :smile:

I already have resources that I plan to use to learn more about .NET (specifically ASP.NET Web API) when I get hired: [ASP.NET Web API tutorial for beginners by kudvenkat](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhW7yoUOGNOfHurUE6bpOO2b) and [Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708/index.html).

If you are doing TDD in your Python project, I'm also interested in joining your team.

But please note also that, even though I first encountered Python many years ago, my recent significant experience with Python is only when I studied the first seven chapters of ["Test-Driven Development with Python"](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html) last June and July 2017, and when I took the "[MIT OpenCourseWare 6.0001"](/2017/08/05/finished-mit-ocw-6.0001/) last July and August 2017.

<h2 id="about-sideline-jobs">
  <strong>About sideline jobs</strong>
</h2>

In my five years of being a software developer, I experienced having a sideline job ony once, and it lasted only one month, because I noticed that having a sideline job does not help me reach some goals I want to reach, such as learning how to create well designed software systems, and learning how to be good at fixing messes which I and other programmers made. 

Because of that, you will be sure that when I sleep at night, I will only be dreaming about the problems that I encounter while working at your company, and not about problems of other companies. :smile:



<!--

### (a) Team member in a new project



If you have an upcoming project that you will be developing from scratch, I would like to present myself to become part of the team. I believe that I can help with the design/architecture of the project (as long as it is using an Object-Oriented language such as C#, Java, or Python).

I am most familiar with If your team will be using a language or frameworks that I'm not familiar with



### (d) Design Guardian (for new projects, through TDD)

Software systems with good design saves a lot of time and headaches for programmers when they need to change something, or when they need to add new features, or when they have a bug to fix.

That, of course, means that it will also save a lot of time and headaches for business people, and for the end-users of the software systems. 

I believe (like Micheal Feathers, Uncle Bob Martin, and many others do) that systems which have good design are systems that are _testable_.

> "If your code is not testable, then it is not well designed."
<br /><br />
> "In general, every time you encounter a testability problem, there is an underlying design problem."
<br /><br />
> --- Micheal Feathers (from "The Deep Synergy Between Testability and Good Design")

Simple rule, right?

_Not testable?... The design must be wrong!_

And what better way do we have today to ensure testability than TDD!

Test-Driven Development (TDD), is a very good way of ensuring that a software system is testable. And testable systems give a very good indication that it is a well designed system (which, like I said above, saves a lot of programmers' time and saves a lot of time of business people's time...)


... But I think that I can only do this role if I am involved in a project from the very start. So you can hire me for this position only if you have a new project which you want to be testable.



You might ask, "How are you going to do this?"

First of all, it would be best if I have a design partner, or you will assign me as partner of your best software designer.

Well, I will do what 


I' not a proponent of good design just for the sake of having a good design. I'm a proponent of good design because it helps in eliminating bugs, and good design helps in eliminating errors that programmers can make.



### (f) TDD Law Enforcer

 We programmers are lazy sometimes. We tend not to care about things --- "as long as it is working, it is okay"

 You might need someone to enforce TDD and not abandon that discipline even during times of crisis and panic.

    "The only way to go fast is to go well" ---- Uncle Bob Martin







### I don't think I'm mean

I believe that being mean will pugong my goal of fixing software systems (when I'm hired to fix one), because I know that I can work alone when fixing existing software systems.




### In case I did not pass the standard of your senior developer(s)

... I can become his apprentice, teaching me about design and other things, so that I can pass on his legacy to the next generation of programmers.

Good day Sir/Ma'am,

I am Jeremiah M. Flaga, a software developer for about five years already.

I experienced being involved in .NET projects for about four years and in an Android project for about a year.


But I believe that I can be able to work on an existing software that uses _any_ technology stack _(with the help of teammates, of course, and of the google search engine)_, most especially when the original designers and current designers of the software structured it so that it can be _easily_ understood by others.


I believe that if you are doing TDD, that means that you are thinking about your future, 
and I want to be involved with a team that brings good

It will be hard for that company to die because they will be making clients happy most of the time, if not all the time. I want to work for that kind of company.



I would like to apply for a job at your company. If you have lots of teams, and I have the freedom to choose which team I want to work with, I would prefer working on a team that creates Web APIs using ASP.NET WebAPI with [TDD](/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/). _(I prepared for ASP.NET WebAPI development by reading the book ["Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001708) which is freely available online.)_


applying in consulting companies.


If you are not using TDD yet, I encourage you to use it because that would be one way of making sure that your employees will not leave you suddenly. TDD is not yet widely used. And many developers who experienced doing TDD do not want to look back or abandon this kind of practice because of the many benefits that it gives them.



If you embrace TDD now, you will attract good designers into your comapny, which will leave other companies wanting good designers. But if that will not happen, at least you helped raise the bar of professionalism in the software development world, while acquiring good designers in the process.





If you have a team that uses [TDD](/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/) as one of their practices, I would like to request you to please let me be involved in that team :smile: (even if the team is _not_ using technologies I am specifically familiar with). If the project is small or medium in size, I believe I can be able to contribute after about a month of familiarizing myself with the technology stack being used in that project (with the help of my teammates, of course :smile:).

I prefer to be involved in a team that uses [TDD](/memorabilia/quotes/tdd/) because I believe that, _today,_ if a team uses TDD as part of their practices, it is a very good indication that the members of that team cares _so much_ about their work, and about their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice TDD do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice TDD cares 'more'.)_

If you do not have a team that uses TDD, I would like to be involved in a team that has code reviews (and/or pair programming) as part of their practices. I want to be involved in that kind of team because, I believe, if a team practices code reviews (and/or pair programming), it indicates that that team cares _so much_ about their work, and their teammates (and, of course, their clients).

_(I'm not saying that those who do not practice code reviews and/or pair programming do not care. I'm just saying that those who practice them cares 'more'.)_

If you do not have a team that practices TDD and/or pair programming

Thank you so much for your time. :smile:




Other programmers might be afraid to mentor because they fear that the one they are mentoring might be the one to replace them in the future.

But my reason for mentoring is so that I can learn from those I am mentoring, not only so that I can teach them what I know. And that means that I will still not become replacable. :smile:




I would prefer working on the Web API part of your software system, because I am not bery good with working with UIs.

But if the team that uses TDD also works with UIs, then I will work with them rather than...

It would also be great working with you if your company has an existing mentoring program, or something like that, for beginning programmers. :+1:

 ### A Human rubber duck

 I might not be the best designer you will ever have, but if you let me talk to people about design, or teach them a little bit about design, that might trigger the designer part within those developers and they will try to become better designers themselves.

I must be allowed to question everything.
I, also, am willing to be questioned about every decision that I make (or made), and I promise I will be very willing to change that decision if I am convinced with the argument of the one who questions.
